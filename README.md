# Actix Web Examples

This repository contains a series of examples that demonstrate the use of the Actix Web framework for building web applications in Rust. Each example is contained in its own directory and can be run independently.

## Getting Started

To run any of these examples, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the example's directory and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Examples

1. [example_zero](./example_zero) - A simple "Hello, World!" application.
2. [example_one](./example_one) - A JSON API that returns a "pong" message.
